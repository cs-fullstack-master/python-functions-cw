Start with a main function and make each problem a function. Call those functions from your main function.

### Problem 1:
Create a function in your program that counts from 0 to [NUMBER]

### Problem 2:
##### We will keep having this problem until EVERYONE gets it right without help
Create a function that has a loop that quits with ‘q’. If the user doesn't enter 'q', ask them to input another string.

### Problem 3:
Create 4 functions called add, subtract, multiply, and divide. Create them to allow a user to perform the name of the function to the two numbers and return the result.

### Problem 4:
Create a function that will ask the user for a number. Use the function to get two numbers, then pass the two numbers to a function and ask a user if they want to add, subtract, multiple, or divide them. Return the result.

### Challenge:
Create the entire program. Create a function that’s passed two numbers and ask if the user wants to add, subtract, multiply, or divide. Return a string that prints the two numbers, which operation it did, and the result.
